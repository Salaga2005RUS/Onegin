AAAAA
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
My tea's gone cold I'm wonder why I..
My tea's gone cold I'm wonder why I..
My tea's gone cold I'm wonder why I..
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I
My tea's gone cold I'm wonder why I..
Neither do I,
Between you and I,
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I
I know there was a time where once I
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM
Eminem killed by M&M
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
I should download her audio on MP3
On "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
They try to shut me down on MTV
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
Behold the final chapter in the saga
He nose dove and sold nada
Teeter-totter caught up between trying to be a father and a
prima donna
Too much for me to wanna
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
And make him eat every carat don't f*ck with dad (haha)
But what happens when karma
You showed me nothing but hate (Haha!)
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
Only realized it was ironic
MCs get taken to school with this music
Just to come and shoot ya
Come be in Shady's world,
Please don't let me be bitchin holdin no regular job
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Guess that they don't know ya
Don't touch what you can't grab,
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
I make elevating music
I'm sorry, Mama
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I'm sorry, Mama
I said I'm sorry, Mama
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
I'm sorry, Mama
I said I'm sorry, Mama
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
You make elevator music
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
My OCD is conking me in the head
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..
1st Chorus: volume gradually grows over raindrop background
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
I'm depressed
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..
with his kid
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
Like I reach my full potential, I peaked
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh hope you can swim good!
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
Come be in shady's world...
Snatch the keys from your hand
A beautiful face is all that you had
We're still together in my head
Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
He's a problem child
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
every time you mad
Just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
thing that we wanted
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
We're all we got in this world
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
I'mma give you the world
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
They're screamin' so loud I'll take one last look at the crowd
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Rappers are having a rough time period
Here's a maxi pad
Off a plank and
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
I'm the walking dead
What I do though for good
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
and snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit and
For that fuck your feelings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Cause when it's going good
Cause I ain't playin' around
This fucking black cloud's still follow's me around
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and
But when it's bad
I feel so ashamed
But your temper's just as bad
But no matter how many fish in the sea
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
You're just as blinded
Next time I'm pissed
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed
Baby mama drama's screamin on and
Shady's back, tell a friend
Censor you like that one line I said
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Angels fight with devils and
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
And make her fall on her face and
And take a vacation to trip a broad
Why be a king when you can be a God?
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
You ran me into the ground
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
Ahem, back by popular demand
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
Oh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
Fuck, your beard's weird
You yellin' at the mic, you weird beard
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, Dad isn't mad
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
You'd look up to me, and for the record
Give your life to be as solidified
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Just to see what we find
They can all get fucked.
Just to see what we find
Hit the lottery, oh wee
Oh they can all get fucked.
Oh they can all get fucked.
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
I was never the type of kid
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Just to see what we find
They can all get fucked.
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
And its absurd how people hang on every word
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
No, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have
a chance
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
lose
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
without me
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a showy he found
she?
down some
I love the way you lie...
The way that you turned your back on me
Come be in shady's world,
When they say all of this is approaching its end
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
With every faggot you slaughtered
Where's my snare?
I represent everything, you take for granted
come be in Shady's world...
Leap tall hoes in a single bound,
Come be in shady's world,
Come be in shady's world...
Ooh girl that's too damn bad,
I'm not phazed,
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)
But I am coming for closure
And I believe I'm striding the roads, I guess I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
But I hate you cause you drained me
But you won't break me
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
But you won't break me
But you're all that I love
I gave you all, you gave me none
Aggressed, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
And you're still in love with me
And after all that's said and done
And left nothing, nothing for me
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
We were Bonnie and Clyde
Are they asking me that because of the sh-t thats been thrown at me
and they genuinly care
I'll get you there
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
I can't breathe
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife
In my windpipe
High of a love
I sufficate
She resuscitates me
She fucking hates me
She's Lois Lane
Who's that dude
I don't even know his name
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...
Come inside
I'mma tie her to the bed
Same routine
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
This song is for anyone
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
And all of this controversy circles me
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
you in time
fine
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Hit the verbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
It's different, it's a certain significance,
A certificate of authenticity, you'd never even see
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
You're the same as me
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
But when it comes to love
Next time
There will be no next time
I apologize
And set the house on fire
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...
By the time they hit fourth grade
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
life
Obie Trice
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
Fuck you, Debbie!
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
You ask for me?
Fix your bent antennae
You got me
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there
Laney, uncle's crazy, aint he?
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
We feel how we feel inside
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
I guess it was never meant to be
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
I don't know what words to use."
Prove that if you were half as nice
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while
But that's all I can be, it's just me
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door it turns to a stage
It's actually disastrously bad
Here's what they want from me
When I blew; see, it was confusing
Poof, then I'm gone
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Of you not knowing what you had until it's gone
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
hahaha..Talk to me...
I'll tell a mo'fuckin slut to her face,
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face,
Am I too nice? buy you ice,
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life,
What you Mariah? fly through twice,
What you tryin to be, my new wife?
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe...
Too much pride,
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me...
Ooh yeah girl run that game...
Haily Jade...I love that name,
Good lordy-wody you must be blown off that water bottle,
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
Love, love
Love, love, love
Don't hurt me no more
Don't hurt me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
How the fuck can him and I battle?
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
You done?
We doin' this once
Why you yellin' at the mic? (Illa)
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
No more
Love
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (No love)
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
That means I'm on top of my game
You get no love
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
Younger me? No, you're the wack me, it's funny but so true
Still can fill a whole page with a ten-year-old's rage
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
Thanks for dissing me
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
In my shoes, just to see
Oh, they can all get fucked.
What it's like, to be me
Feel your pain, you feel mine
It's like all eyes on me
And half of them ain't even funny like
In every single place
In my shoes, just to see
Oh, they can all get fucked.
What it's like, to be me
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In my shoes, just to see
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone...
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Feels like no one can beat me
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
something
drowning
See Slim; {*screaming*}
And go about your life, like it was nothing
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
Doody, most of my life its just been me and you there
yeah I say it now and you can't hear me
but somehow I know you're near me in presence
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
I'm done being your punching bag
I'm like you gon fry and like
I'm moaning I just wanna get home
I'm still angry, yeah, I maybe
I may never trust someone
like I'm on fire
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Yeah, It's been a ride…
I guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
when I look over and his shirt is off
His soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
You can get stomped by Obie
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All my life I was very deprived
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Well, since age twelve, I felt like I'm someone else
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
And at the exact same time
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
I'll give you one underdog, then you got to swing by yourself
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
I'm supposed to set an example
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
I'mma work for everything I have
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
We have nothing in common, poodle
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause
It's me
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
But sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line
Add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Suge
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
Guess who? D'you miss me?
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
You're the one they adore
You're too old
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
And that's why, my love
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
If i'm such a f*ckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
Except for a dream, and a f*ckin' rap magazine
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Let off then I'm reloading
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep-throating
Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Don't be a retard, be a king?
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Since you love you're city so much
Uh huh...
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
You can barely breathe
You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me
You don't know me
Drunk from the hate
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Yeah
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I like the sound of that, yeah
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
Young Money, yeah
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
No love lost, no love found
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
That's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
And I don't need you (No more)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
Yeah!
Yeah, that's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Dr. Dre! 2020!
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong.
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
In my whole entire life, I can (Yeah)
I ain't never giving in again (Yeah)
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah!)
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh!)
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah!)
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah!)
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Now you're in each other's face
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Now you get to watch her leave
Everybody only wants to discuss me
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
I love the way you lie...
But it's just me I'm just obscene
20 million other white rappers emerge
It'd be so empty without me
We're gonna have a problem here...
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
masteroff.org
With the wind in his bag
masteroff.org
This world is mine for the taking
When I'm not cooperating
You waited this long now stop debating
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
But it feels so empty without me
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
You ever love somebody so much
I love you too much
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
To walk away though
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
You're a rock star (Baby) (Yeah)
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
So one last time, I'm back
And we fall back
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
Baby please come back
Baby it was me
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Quicker than a shock
So just let me revel and bask
Well I'm back
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)
got out of bed at all
Shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
So are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
made me sick
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
It's all political, if my music is literal, and i'm a criminal how the f*ck
Or shot up on the block
Shady made me, but tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye-baby, huh...
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just smile back 
But I'm only going to get this one chance
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack
Backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac
Feel my wrath of attack
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah
I can't wait, I'm going back
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Little white toothpick
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old") -ow, Kelly-ooh
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the fuck?)
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
I'm sick of you bein' whack
and I can't see at all
but your picture on my wall
got out of bed at all
and I can't see at all
but your picture on my wall
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
I hope you know I ripped ALL of your pictures off the wall
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll
got out of bed at all
and I can't see at all
but your picture on my wall
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
Polluting the air waves a rebel
Now let's go, just give me the signal
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
can I raise a little girl
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
My honesty's brutal
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
I'm drunk. So, Satan, take the fucking wheel
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
You write normal? Fuck being normal
Laugh at every single joke I crack
You're pointless as Rapunzel
You're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
You fuckin'... oh
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special
I know you want me, girl
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Cause I'm
When you're with them
Even know what hit 'em
I love the way you lie...
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
And I am whatever you say I am
And I am whatever you say I am
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
And it's burnin', and I have returned
And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool
Checks in the mail
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause man I can hear 'em
She keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
I keep havin' this dream
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
End up with two back hands,
To the kids who play 'em
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them
No more fans that are calling your name, cameras are off
As we pick up the last Mathers left off
But I do know one thing though,
But I do know one thing though,
But I do know one thing though,
If you don't stop after they call you the
First thing you said...
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
He knows that, but he's broke
In my voice when I talk
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand,
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
So this must mean I'm disgusting
It don't matter, he's dope
So before you rest your case
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
I just want her back
Look me in the eyeball
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
Mmmhh
I'ma name her Bonnie
him
Yeahh...
Yeah?
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they suck
mortom
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? you make me sick,
That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase,
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
Superman aint savin shit, girl you can jump on shady's dick,
Can't we fuck?
Don't get me wrong,
Twice the magic that started it all
I'm here to save you girl,
Let's let our love unfurl.
I wanna save you girl,
him?
Bitch you make me hurl...
I'm here to save you girl,
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
You want what you can't have,
Girl you just blew your chance,
First off you don't know Marshall,
Lets let our love unfurl,
Bitch you make me hurl.
Add also, don't grow partial,
That's ammo for my arsenal,
I'll snap you off that bar stool,
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
Sad, but it happens to all of them
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Feminist women love Eminem
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
Get 'em!
And I don't need you (No more)
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
I'll get back up and uhhh
I'll get back up and uhhh
I'll get back up and uhhh
Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Cause if you could've took my life you would've
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Other side of my pack and stuck a spike, too, should've
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
or I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh
No one could hurt me like you could've
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
I'm here to save you girl,
Lets let our love unfurl,
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Now I gotta cock back, aim
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
To fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
That we didn't mean
I ain't here to save the fucking children
I wanna save you girl,
Bitch you make me hurl.
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
But if one kid out of a hundred million
fan
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
a fan
Damn!
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
They call me Superman,
They call me Superman,
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
I've been driving around your side of this town
New plan Stan
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Now say you hate homos again!
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
I'll never let another chick bring me down,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
I can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Your superman, your superman...
We'll see how much you'll be partying then,
I'll call you again,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend,
And a life we could've had and we could've been
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
I'm way too up to back down
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn..?
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn???
I guess I don't know my own strength
I'll never stoop so low again
But you lied again
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
At the dry wall
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn???
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
Guess who's back, back again
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Could start a revolution
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Dre, just let it run
Fuck it, shut up and listen
I don't see us ever being together ever again
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
What happens when you become the main source of pain
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
Make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
Chorus: Dido
drowning
got out of bed at all
and I can't see at all
but your picture on my wall
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from
do
four hours and you just said, "No."
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any f*ckin'
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the f*ck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
Cause we consider these minutes golden
They're gone, and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Never know what kind of car i'll be in,
That's when I wake up, alarm clocks ringin'
There's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
You kicked me when I was down
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
die too
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, get down
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
I just wanted to fit in
Not just based on my description
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
was to
I think I love you too...
Bitches they come, they go,
Monday through sunday yo,
How could it ever be just us two?
Bitches they come they go,
Monday through Sunday yo,
Bitches they come they go,
Monday through Sunday yo,
I think I love you too,
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
When a tornado meets a volcano
Then you wonder: "How can
Back to the lab again yo
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
You own it, you better never let it go
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
Let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Ninety-nine percent of my life, I was lied to
There you go
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Yo, yo
Ayo
Ayo
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions go…
And if you ask me too
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Don't feel no pain
Like something's about to happen
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren
Into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Blow up and be in a position
At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
Enough rhymes to
You get too big and here they come trying to
Well, that's what they do
I wrote it on the Starter cap
Toilets clogged, Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
I'm the hindsight to say, "I told you so!"
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
it must have been at least 16 years ago
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh”
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
it was like 90 degrees, I was catching a sun burn
it don't stop there
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
I snap
masteroff.org
You push
Now you're getting fucking sick
Used to get 'em
Maybe our relationship
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
With his windows down and his system up
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
We all fall down...
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his ressurection
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
Now break it down, girl
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
On her massive gluteus maximus again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
Now come in, girl
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
How many verses I gotta murder to
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
You know you want me too
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
Ha-ha, woo!
Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
To burn it in front of you, ho
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
Well can it load a gun up for you, and c*ck it too
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
Stiffen up that upper lip
While he played piano
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
2nd Chorus: full volume with beat right after
There probably was a problem at the post office or
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your
daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm about to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer
I wanna grow together,
black people they got melatonin
Whatever weather, cold or warm
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
in their skin, we don't burn"
the motor city mo-town
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for
I never knew my father neither;
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
Oh, you thought it was over
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
Just to see what it'd be like to
Just to see what it'd be like to
Just to see what it'd be like to
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...
Just as soon as I walk in
Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Just stay true to you so
Just stay true to you so
So...
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
To focus soley on handling my responsibility's as a father
Of looking at 'em
And I don't need you (No more)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You swore you've never hit 'em
Never do nothing to hurt 'em
When you spit 'em
Spewing venom
Scratch, claw, bit 'em
Pin 'em
When you're in 'em
Throw 'em down
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn???
So I must then get, off the bus then slip
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
We should be together too
up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter
and here's an autograph for your brother,
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I say that shit just clowning dog,
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
Before it fades into black and it's all over
I know what you wanna hear...
I wanna grow together,
I wanna grow together,
I wanna save you girl,
I laid hands on her
Pull each other's hair
It's the rage that took over
Yesterday is over
Playin' over
I know I'm a liar
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better,
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better,
I've created a monster
They want Shady I'm chopped liver
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Uh)
You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah!)
You kicked me when I was down
But now he's fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Shut the fuck up!
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (hold up)
I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
And flip them, don't expect no help
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
Straighten up little soldier
This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap
Inspired enough to one day grow up
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
But it's "Fuck the world," get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
Next to Ja, next to Benzino-die, motherfucker!
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
fans
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
I know you got my last two letters;
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
wrists too?
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
It's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
You left our family in shambles
You can just close the chapter
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, go!
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
The cause of my problems
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
And you must hate me
And you've had enough of me
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
And it's a disaster
And up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Cause I'm stronger than I was
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends
Doody, thats what we call each other
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
Cause I'm stronger than I was.
and dawg you'll never believe this
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
man how you touch so many f-cking lives and just leave us
difficult as it sounds
and by the way them playboy rings
hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
yeah, as difficult as it sounds
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for christmas
Now I know we said things
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
Did things
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I have no snare in my headphones
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a "My Name Is"
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Yeah I know sometimes things may not always
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
I'm not taking any chances
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
How could I not blow? All I do is drop "F" bombs
Ill when I speak in tongues
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Now I lead a new school full of students
Life's handing you lemons
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
And start over from scratch and write new ones
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
With this like winning a huge meet
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
Into the same patterns
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
But I'm actually weirder than you think
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
I'm the ringing in your ears
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
That, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
The baggage you had, but as you gather up all your possessions
Trapped in his own drawings
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Tap into thoughts
Kiss my dick, hit my cash, i'd rather have you whip my ass,
I love these hoes,
Everybody knows,
That's about as far as your buddy goes,
We'll be friends,
Don't mean to ruin your plans,
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
Da da dum da dum da da
I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
To seize the moment and don't squander it
As mine is
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
To the same plant, and the same pants
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo, you better
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
I'm torn in my limbs, by each one of my friends
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens
All I know is
Even though I know it's lies
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, sing for the year
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' as*
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, sing for the year
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' sh*t in they eyes
Like fuck it i understand this is business
Give every kid who got played at
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates that's great
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was phat
tell it
it?
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
Night"
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
about it
about it
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
that
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
or maybe you just need to treat her better
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
and I clam up (wham) I just slam shut
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
best
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get
it
it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
if the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'm tired of the games
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I can't tell you what it really is
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
Yeah them chills
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
No, he won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes
He's so stacked that he knows
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
Just when I may have needed you most
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
See, it's sad it came to this point
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Real name no gimmicks
I just settled all my lawsuits
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
When they get jealous, they confuse it
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cos you
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
When your fans become your haters
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
Lethal injection
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (pop)
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
Coming back on you every woman you insult
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became
Don't put out? i'll put you out,
Won't get out? i'll push you out,
Puss blew out, copin shit,
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out,
It's no secret,
Bitch so what?
You don't want that,
But I guess that's just what sluts do,
Not a jealous man, but females lie,
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys,
There goes another lawsuit,
and I still have to get you back for that sh-t
and the entire time you're just laughing at me
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
But it's time to exercise these demons
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
And I love it
And I love it the more that I suffer
And right before I'm about to drown
And these words
It's going great
We're running right back
It's so insane
It's awful
Here we go again
I'm Superman
You meet
Told you this is my fault
I'll aim my fist
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
But sometimes the shit just seems
There's a concept that works
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
Kids
So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
What do you know? Oops
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
I'll give him my sandals
Go inside each other's minds
Who else want it, Kells?
But I need something to pull me out this dump,
If I could just get over this hump
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Everything is so tense and gloom
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...
Fell down and I got right back up
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
So I decided just to pick this pen
Attempt fails, Budden, L's
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
ain't like you
c'mon - how fucked up is you?
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Never loved you enough to trust you,
We just met and I just fucked you,
Leave handprints all accross you,
You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer
Cause I'm stronger than I was
First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
Cause you left and you took everything I had left
Cause on the inside you're ugly, man
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
And burst in a ball of flames
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
What size you wear? I wear tens
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
and I continuosly stare at pictures of you
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
And when I'm gone, just carry on
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma break that birdie's neck
It's my life...
Yeah...
Daddy's with you in your prayers
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Two little beautiful girls
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
So I crunch rhymes
With fucking cornrows
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
And at the time every house that we lived in
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
His f*ckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
But I promise momma's gon' be alright
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
Not the expression
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
No, literally give an arm for
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spittin' image of her
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
But things have gotten so bad between us
But baby, wait!
In my own words, I guess...
Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seats
What you crying about?
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
Everything's gonna be alright
I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
But I promise momma's gon' be alright
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
They're sayin' you got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
Everything's gonna be alright
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket, it's got her picture
I take a bow and thank you all for comin' out
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream "Die, Shady!" and pop it
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot
Made a living and a killing off it
Never asked nobody for shit
You're rodent, I'm omnipotent
Alright
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
I'm asleep in the front seat
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But fuck it
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
Think not
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
Uh, be good or be good at it
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
When I'm not even in my harshest
So I try to avoid any eye contact
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
Go inside each other's minds
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Nobody asked for life to deal us
Go inside each other's minds
When you're so good that you can't say it
People just get sick 'cause you spit
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Now Ja said I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
The morning rain clouds up my window..
The morning rain clouds up my window..
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
The morning rain clouds up my window..
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
You know you want me baby,
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)
By 29 I had three albums that had blew
We gotta take these cards ourselves
To wait by the door and pack his bags
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
To seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
You know I want you too,
I'm here to rescue you,
if its true, how the f-ck am I supposed to get over you
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
we was always brothers
never thought about each others skin colours
tryna walk under the trees
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
just to give me some comfort
meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt
well Nate finally got em back sh-t
moving past it, it still aint registered yet
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
mothafucka they can be great
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that
It's f*cked up ain't it
it
songs and we can…
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our
Sing with me, sing for the year
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes
And this shit just isn't none of my business
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'
Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (brrt)
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
We all fall down like toy soldiers
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
To have Runyan Ave and who sulked us up in our corners
We all fall down like toy soldiers
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
but you can bet you're legacy they'll never forget
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I will stand tall
I will not fall
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
And have a man-bun?
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Until my legs (Until my legs)
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post
Lonely roads, God only knows
These ho's don't want him no mo, he's cold product
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
You'll never live without
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
Rihanna just hit me on the text
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
I don't need no fucking man servant
Daddy will be home soon
And get up and get my own
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
Now I could have either just
Every school I went
Aunt Edna always told me "Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that"
It's probably 110% different
In each other's shoes, at least
Let's see if you can fit your feet
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
Until the roof (Until the roof)
Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
Turns right around and bites you
Ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
Where must I go, who must I know
When I'm a million leagues above you
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
my mother stole from you
It wasn't you
So they say it's best
So lost in the moments
It controls you both
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
And neither one of you
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
Don't wanna see you
Don't wanna see you
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
I'm the only one for you
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three foot 11
I just want to be just like you
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Continue to peep, still bent low
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
Got no ring on this finger now,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
what the f-ck good does that do me now
but Sharonda actually talks to me now
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
well I put em in your cask-owww
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
Out the window
But you promised her
To go your separate ways
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
He's chokin, how everybody's chokin now
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You own it, you better never let it go
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!)
Just stay true to you
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo,
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You own it, you better never let it go
You own it, you better never let it go
You own it, you better never let it go
You own it, you better never let it go
Cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
If there's anything you have left to say
You high baby?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
To intervene between me and this monster
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders)
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
You want me to tell you somethin?
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
Cause I need an interventionist
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
So oh oh
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
No more crying, wipe them tears
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
Make sense to you right now
I know it's confusing you
See if I get away with it now
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
You can still get roasted, 'cause Marsh is not mellow
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow!)
And baby, you know
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
Matthew
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
The morning rain clouds up my window..
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Fuck it, let's all stand up!
And I try, sit alone and I cry
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Just to try to get people to buy
I think I love you baby...
You know you want me baby,
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
You know I want you too,
Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
I'm here to rescue you,
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
oh boy you drive me crazy...
Oh boy you drive me crazy...
They call me Superman,
I'm single now,
Saturday through sunday monday,
Maybe i'll love you one day,
Saturday through Sunday monday,
Maybe I'll love you one day,
Sing with me now, just for today
I know you want me baby,
I think I love you baby...
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to make you cry
I think I want you too...
I think I love you too,
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to hurt you
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
Oh boy you drive me crazy...
They call me Superman,
You know you want me baby,
You know I want you too,
I'm here to rescue you,
I hang around big stars all day,
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
Love that tattoo...what's that say?
Saturday through Sunday Monday,
Maybe I'll love you one day,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
I know you want me baby,
I think I love you baby...
I think I want you too...
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
Time to put my life back together right now
Admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
I'mma be late for the pity party
It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
But if you blame me, you're crazy
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
They ask me am I ok. They ask me if I'm happy
or am I just a little snappy
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
And I just can't keep living this way
You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
But I still fight
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
Put a ??? and lift the whole liquor counter up
While I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right
It's like I'm in flight
It's like I'm huffing paint
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry??!
Cause today
Sound like broken records
Next time you'll show restraint
That was yesterday
It's a different day
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry??!
Don't you hear sincerity
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry??!
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
Yo, His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy
This whole rap city
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
And it's no movie, there's no Makai Pfeiffer, this is my
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
that I got
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
Feet fail me not or not this may be the only opportunity
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
A visionary, vision is scary
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
A tisk-it a task-it
I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
And Moby
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
To do black music so selfishly
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to hurt you
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Sing with me now, just for today
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to hurt you
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
And it seems like the media immediately
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
of these streets quickly
was a fist that hit you…
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Sing with me now, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
We feel how we feel inside
And everything you stand for turns on you despite you
I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
That's Slim Shady
Yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Almost as if to... say
Something's wrong, I can feel it
Just a feeling I've got
But I don't know what
I'm an MC still as honest
With this rappity brat
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
Immortality like I have got
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew)
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Little gay-looking boy
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
On the cable channel
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, looking boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay
That's all they say, looking boy
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what d'you say, looking boy?
Unghh, school flunky, pill junky
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
Get outta my face, looking boy
Full of myself, but still hungry
Still "Chunky, but Funky"
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
You're a rock star (Baby)
You're a rock star (Baby)
You're a rock star (Baby)
We're the ones who made you
We're the ones who made you
We're the ones who made you
Don't try to deny it, baby
So baby
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
But I just can't sit back and wallow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
I took my bruises, took my lumps
But I already told you my whole life story
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Look at shit through each other's eyes
So let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
In order for me to pick the mic back up
But I just can't admit
You know I love you
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
Just stay true to you
Even if it sounds corny,
I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
In my own sorrow
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
You're fuckin' salty
And I'm just playin', Diddy
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cuz
But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz
