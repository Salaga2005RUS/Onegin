20 million other white rappers emerge
2nd Chorus: full volume with beat right after
A beautiful face is all that you had
A certificate of authenticity, you'd never even see
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest
A tisk-it a task-it
A visionary, vision is scary
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
Add also, don't grow partial,
Add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
Admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
After the track is demolished
Aggressed, you can't leave
Ahem, back by popular demand
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)
All I know is
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
All my life I was very deprived
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
Almost as if to... say
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
Alright
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
Am I too nice? buy you ice,
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
And I am whatever you say I am
And I am whatever you say I am
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I believe I'm striding the roads, I guess I can't breathe
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
And I cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
And I don't need you (No more)
And I don't need you (No more)
And I don't need you (No more)
And I don't need you (No more)
And I don't need you (No more)
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
And I just can't keep living this way
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And I love it
And I love it the more that I suffer
And I should not be woken
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
And I try, sit alone and I cry
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And I'm just playin', Diddy
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
And Moby
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
And a life we could've had and we could've been
And after all that's said and done
And all of this controversy circles me
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
And at the exact same time
And at the time every house that we lived in
And baby, you know
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And burst in a ball of flames
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
And everything you stand for turns on you despite you
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
And flew you and momma out to see me
And flip them, don't expect no help
And gee who better to talk to than you?
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
And get up and get my own
And go about your life, like it was nothing
And half of them ain't even funny like
And have a man-bun?
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they suck
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
And if you ask me too
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
And it seems like the media immediately
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
And it's a disaster
And it's burnin', and I have returned
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
And it's no movie, there's no Makai Pfeiffer, this is my
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
And its absurd how people hang on every word
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door it turns to a stage
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
And left nothing, nothing for me
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
And make her fall on her face and
And make him eat every carat don't f*ck with dad (haha)
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
And neither one of you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
And put hands on her mother, who's a spittin' image of her
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And right before I'm about to drown
And right now there's a steel knife
And save me from myself and all this conflict
And set the house on fire
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
And show these people what my level of skill's like
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!)
And start over from scratch and write new ones
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And that's why, my love
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, go!
And there's a million of us just like me
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
And these words
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
And this shit just isn't none of my business
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
And understand the discrimination
And up under your skin like a splinter
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
And we fall back
And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
And when I'm gone, just carry on
And when I'm gone, just carry on
And when I'm gone, just carry on
And when I'm gone, just carry on
And when I'm gone, just carry on
And when I'm gone, just carry on
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
And you must hate me
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you're still in love with me
And you've had enough of me
And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
Angels fight with devils and
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Appeal with the skin color of mine
Are they asking me that because of the sh-t thats been thrown at me
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
As long as the wrong feels right
As mine is
As we pick up the last Mathers left off
At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
At the dry wall
Attempt fails, Budden, L's
Aunt Edna always told me "Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that"
Ayo
Ayo
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Baby it was me
Baby mama drama's screamin on and
Baby please come back
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, get down
Back to the lab again yo
Backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (No love)
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Between you and I,
Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life,
Bitch so what?
Bitch you make me hurl.
Bitch you make me hurl.
Bitch you make me hurl...
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
Bitches they come they go,
Bitches they come they go,
Bitches they come, they go,
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Blend in with the rest of the room
Blow up and be in a position
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
But I already told you my whole life story
But I am coming for closure
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
But I do know one thing though,
But I do know one thing though,
But I do know one thing though,
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
But I don't know what
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
But I got your mom deep-throating
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
But I guess that's just what sluts do,
But I hate you cause you drained me
But I just can't admit
But I just can't sit back and wallow
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
But I need something to pull me out this dump,
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
But I promise momma's gon' be alright
But I promise momma's gon' be alright
But I still fight
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
But I'm actually weirder than you think
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I'm only going to get this one chance
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
But at least have the decency in you
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
But baby, wait!
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
But fuck it
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
But if I can't batter the women
But if I was three foot 11
But if one kid out of a hundred million
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
But if you blame me, you're crazy
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas
But in my head there's something
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
But it feels so empty without me
But it's "Fuck the world," get a child out her
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
But it's just me I'm just obscene
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
But it's time to exercise these demons
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our
But no matter how many fish in the sea
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
But now he's fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
But sometimes the shit just seems
But sometimes when you combine
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cuz
But that's all I can be, it's just me
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
But things have gotten so bad between us
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
But what comes around goes around
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
But what happens when karma
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
But when it comes to love
But when it's bad
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
But you lied again
But you promised her
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
But you won't break me
But you won't break me
But you won't break me
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
But you're all that I love
But you're losin' the fight you picked
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
But your temper's just as bad
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
By 29 I had three albums that had blew
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
By the time they hit fourth grade
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can't we fuck?
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck
Cause I ain't playin' around
Cause I need an interventionist
Cause I'm
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
Cause I'm stronger than I was
Cause I'm stronger than I was
Cause I'm stronger than I was.
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
Cause if you could've took my life you would've
Cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
Cause on the inside you're ugly, man
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Cause today
Cause we consider these minutes golden
Cause when it's going good
Cause you left and you took everything I had left
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Censor you like that one line I said
Checks in the mail

Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
Come be in Shady's world,
Come be in shady's world,
Come be in shady's world,
Come be in shady's world...
Come be in shady's world...
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
Come inside
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Coming back on you every woman you insult
Continue to peep, still bent low
Could start a revolution
Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there
Da da dum da dum da da
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
Daddy will be home soon
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
Daddy's with you in your prayers
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God

Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Don't mean to ruin your plans,
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
Don't mistake him for Satan
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice

Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
Dre, just let it run
Drunk from the hate
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
Eminem killed by M&M
End up with two back hands,
Enough rhymes to
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
Even if it meant acting stupid
Even if it sounds corny,
Even know what hit 'em
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
Even though I know it's lies
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
Every school I went
Everybody come take my hand
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone...
Everybody knows,
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Everybody only wants to discuss me
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Everything is so tense and gloom
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Except for a dream, and a f*ckin' rap magazine
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Feel my wrath of attack
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Feels like no one can beat me
Feet fail me not or not this may be the only opportunity
Fell down and I got right back up
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
Feminist women love Eminem
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
First off you don't know Marshall,
First thing you said...
First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
Fix your bent antennae
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
For a dad to show up who never did
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
For that fuck your feelings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit and
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
Fuck it, let's all stand up!
Fuck it, shut up and listen
Fuck you, Debbie!
Fuck, your beard's weird
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Full of myself, but still hungry
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung
Get 'em!
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Get outta my face, looking boy
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Girl you just blew your chance,
Give every kid who got played at
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)
Give your life to be as solidified
Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
Go inside each other's minds
Go inside each other's minds
Go inside each other's minds
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket, it's got her picture
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
Good lordy-wody you must be blown off that water bottle,
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Got no ring on this finger now,
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the fuck?)
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
Guess that they don't know ya
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back, back again
Guess who? D'you miss me?
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
Ha-ha, woo!
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Haily Jade...I love that name,
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his ressurection
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
He does not mean to lesbian offend
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
He knows that, but he's broke
He nose dove and sold nada
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
He's a problem child
He's chokin, how everybody's chokin now
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for christmas
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy
He's so stacked that he knows
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Here today, gone tomorrow
Here we go again
Here's a maxi pad
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Here's what they want from me
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
Hey, looking boy, what d'you say, looking boy?
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"
High of a love
His f*ckin' dad walkin' out
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions go…
His soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Hit the lottery, oh wee
Hit the verbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
How could I not blow? All I do is drop "F" bombs
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
How could it ever be just us two?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
How many verses I gotta murder to
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
How the fuck can him and I battle?
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any f*ckin'
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
I ain't here to save the fucking children
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer
I ain't never giving in again (Yeah)
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
I am your lack of a conscience
I apologize
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
I can feel tugging and struggling
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I can only tell you what it feels like
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can't be your superman,
I can't breathe
I can't tell you what it really is
I can't wait, I'm going back
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
I don't even know his name
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I don't know what words to use."
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
I don't know, that's just the way I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am
I don't need no fucking man servant
I don't see us ever being together ever again
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys,
I dreamed of being that cool kid
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I feel so ashamed
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
I gave you all, you gave me none
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
I got a laptop in my back pocket
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
I guess I don't know my own strength
I guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
I guess it was never meant to be
I guess we would have to walk a mile
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want
I hang around big stars all day,
I have no snare in my headphones
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
I hope you know I ripped ALL of your pictures off the wall
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I just get on the mic and spit it
I just settled all my lawsuits
I just want her back
I just want to be just like you
I just wanted to fit in
I keep havin' this dream
I know I'm a liar
I know it's confusing you
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
I know there was a time where once I
I know what you wanna hear...
I know you got my last two letters;
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest
I know you want me baby,
I know you want me baby,
I know you want me, girl
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
I laid hands on her
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was phat
I like the sound of that, yeah
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...
I love these hoes,
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
I love you too much
I make elevating music
I may never trust someone
I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
I never knew my father neither;
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to make you cry
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I represent everything, you take for granted
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
I say that shit just clowning dog,
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
I should download her audio on MP3
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
I snap
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
I sufficate
I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on
I take a bow and thank you all for comin' out
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
I think I love you baby...
I think I love you baby...
I think I love you baby...
I think I love you too,
I think I love you too,
I think I love you too...
I think I want you too...
I think I want you too...
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I took my bruises, took my lumps
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
I wanna grow together,
I wanna grow together,
I wanna grow together,
I wanna save you girl,
I wanna save you girl,
I wanna save you girl,
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
I was never the type of kid
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Suge
I will not fall
I will stand tall
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
I'll aim my fist
I'll be one tough act to follow
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
I'll call you again,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend,
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
I'll get back up and uhhh
I'll get back up and uhhh
I'll get back up and uhhh
I'll get you there
I'll give him my sandals
I'll give you one underdog, then you got to swing by yourself
I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
I'll never let another chick bring me down,
I'll never stoop so low again
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'll snap you off that bar stool,
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
I'll tell a mo'fuckin slut to her face,
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
I'm Superman
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
I'm an MC still as honest
I'm asleep in the front seat
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
I'm depressed
I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
I'm done being your punching bag
I'm drunk. So, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'm here to rescue you,
I'm here to rescue you,
I'm here to rescue you,
I'm here to save you girl,
I'm here to save you girl,
I'm here to save you girl,
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
I'm like you gon fry and like
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I'm moaning I just wanna get home
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not afraid to take a stand
I'm not gonna be able to top a "My Name Is"
I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz
I'm not phazed,
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'm not taking any chances
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
I'm sick of you bein' whack
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
I'm single now,
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
I'm sorry, Mama
I'm sorry, Mama
I'm sorry, Mama
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm starting to feel distant again
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
I'm still angry, yeah, I maybe
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
I'm supposed to set an example
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
I'm the hindsight to say, "I told you so!"
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm the only one for you
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the walking dead
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
I'm tired of the games
I'm torn in my limbs, by each one of my friends
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
I'm way too up to back down
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
I'ma name her Bonnie
I'mma be late for the pity party
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma give you the world
I'mma sing for you
I'mma tie her to the bed
I'mma work for everything I have
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
I've been driving around your side of this town
I've created a monster
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
If I could just get over this hump
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
If i'm such a f*ckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble
If there's anything you have left to say
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
If you don't stop after they call you the
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
Ill when I speak in tongues
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
Immortality like I have got
In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? you make me sick,
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
In each other's shoes, at least
In every single place
In my own sorrow
In my own words, I guess...
In my shoes, just to see
In my shoes, just to see
In my shoes, just to see
In my voice when I talk
In my whole entire life, I can (Yeah)
In my windpipe
In order for me to pick the mic back up
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
In the paper, the news, every day I am
In the paper, the news, every day I am
In the paper, the news, every day I am
In the paper, the news, every day I am
In the paper, the news, every day I am
In the paper, the news, every day I am
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Into the same patterns
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
Isn't as crazy as it seems
It controls you both
It don't matter, he's dope
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
It wasn't you
It'd be so empty without me
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
It's a different day
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Uh)
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
It's actually disastrously bad
It's all political, if my music is literal, and i'm a criminal how the f*ck
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
It's awful
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
It's different, it's a certain significance,
It's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
It's f*cked up ain't it
It's funny
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
It's going great
It's got a ring to it don't it?
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
It's like I'm huffing paint
It's like I'm in flight
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
It's like all eyes on me
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
It's me
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
It's my life...
It's no secret,
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
It's over, nobody listens to techno
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
It's probably 110% different
It's so insane
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
It's the rage that took over
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
It's your moment
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
Just a feeling I've got
Just as soon as I walk in
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry??!
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry??!
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry??!
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn..?
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn???
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn???
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn???
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Just smile back 
Just stay true to you
Just stay true to you
Just stay true to you so
Just stay true to you so
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...
Just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
Just to come and shoot ya
Just to see what it'd be like to
Just to see what it'd be like to
Just to see what it'd be like to
Just to see what we find
Just to see what we find
Just to see what we find
Just to try to get people to buy
Just when I may have needed you most
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Kids
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
Killin' the flow, slow venom
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
Kiss my dick, hit my cash, i'd rather have you whip my ass,
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
Laney, uncle's crazy, aint he?
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Laugh at every single joke I crack
Leap tall hoes in a single bound,
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
Leave handprints all accross you,
Let go
Let me know when it occurs to you
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Let off then I'm reloading
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh”
Let's let our love unfurl.
Let's see if you can fit your feet
Lethal injection
Lets let our love unfurl,
Lets let our love unfurl,
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Life is no Nintendo game
Life's handing you lemons
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Like I reach my full potential, I peaked
Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
Like fuck it i understand this is business
Like something's about to happen
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
Little gay-looking boy
Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Little white toothpick
Lonely roads, God only knows
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
Look me in the eyeball
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
Love
Love that tattoo...what's that say?
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Love, love
Love, love, love
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
MCs get taken to school with this music
Made a living and a killing off it
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
Make lemonade then
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
Make sense to you right now
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
Matthew
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Maybe I'll love you one day,
Maybe I'll love you one day,
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
Maybe i'll love you one day,
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
Maybe our relationship
Maybe that's what happens
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
Maybe we'll someday grow,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Mmmhh
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
Monday through Sunday yo,
Monday through Sunday yo,
Monday through sunday yo,
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
My OCD is conking me in the head
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm about to be a father
My honesty's brutal
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
My tea's gone cold I'm wonder why I..
My tea's gone cold I'm wonder why I..
My tea's gone cold I'm wonder why I..
My tea's gone cold I'm wonder why I..
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Need to get the cock up out it
Neither do I,
Never asked nobody for shit
Never do nothing to hurt 'em
Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Never know what kind of car i'll be in,
Never loved you enough to trust you,
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
New plan Stan
Next time
Next time I'm pissed
Next time you'll show restraint
Next to Ja, next to Benzino-die, motherfucker!
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Night"
Ninety-nine percent of my life, I was lied to
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
No love lost, no love found
No more
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
No more crying, wipe them tears
No more fans that are calling your name, cameras are off
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
No one could hurt me like you could've
No patience is in me and if you offend me
No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
No, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
No, he won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
No, literally give an arm for
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I
Nobody asked for life to deal us
Not a jealous man, but females lie,
Not just based on my description
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Not the expression
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Now I could have either just
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
Now I know we said things
Now I lead a new school full of students
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Now Ja said I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
Now break it down, girl
Now come in, girl
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late
Now how the f*ck did this metamorphosis happen
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
Now let's go, just give me the signal
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
Now say you hate homos again!
Now some of you might still be in that place
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
Now you get to watch her leave
Now you're getting fucking sick
Now you're in each other's face
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Obie Trice
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause
Of looking at 'em
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
Of you not knowing what you had until it's gone
Off a plank and
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road
Oh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
Oh boy you drive me crazy...
Oh boy you drive me crazy...
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
Oh they can all get fucked.
Oh they can all get fucked.
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
Oh, they can all get fucked.
Oh, they can all get fucked.
Oh, you thought it was over
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
On "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
On her massive gluteus maximus again
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
On the cable channel
On the wall of shame
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian
One tough act to follow
One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
Only realized it was ironic
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Ooh girl that's too damn bad,
Ooh yeah girl run that game...
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
Or let me be me so let me see
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
Or shot up on the block
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
Other side of my pack and stuck a spike, too, should've
Out the window
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Oy vey, that boy's gay
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
People just get sick 'cause you spit
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Pin 'em
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face,
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (hold up)
Playin' over
Please don't let me be bitchin holdin no regular job
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up?
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
Polluting the air waves a rebel
Poof, then I'm gone
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Prove that if you were half as nice
Pull each other's hair
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
Puss blew out, copin shit,
Put 'em all in a line
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand,
Put a ??? and lift the whole liquor counter up
Put it to my brain, scream "Die, Shady!" and pop it
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
Quicker than a shock
Radio won't even play my jam
Radio won't even play my jam
Radio won't even play my jam
Rappers are having a rough time period
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
Real name no gimmicks
Realized I forgot to call you back
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
Rihanna just hit me on the text
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church
Sad, but it happens to all of them
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
Same routine
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Saturday through Sunday Monday,
Saturday through Sunday monday,
Saturday through sunday monday,
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (brrt)
Scratch, claw, bit 'em
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
See Slim; {*screaming*}
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cos you
See if I get away with it now
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
See, it's sad it came to this point
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
Shady made me, but tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye-baby, huh...
Shady's back, tell a friend
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin
She fucking hates me
She keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
She resuscitates me
She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands
She's Lois Lane
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Since you love you're city so much
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me now, just for today
Sing with me now, just for today
Sing with me now, just for today
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seats
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh hope you can swim good!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Snatch the keys from your hand
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
So I crunch rhymes
So I decided just to pick this pen
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
So I must then get, off the bus then slip
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
So I try to avoid any eye contact
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
So are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?
So baby
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
So before you rest your case
So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, looking boy
So here I go is my shot.
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it
So just let me revel and bask
So let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
So lost in the moments
So oh oh
So one last time, I'm back
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
So the FCC won't let me be
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
So they say it's best
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
So this must mean I'm disgusting
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
So why don't you all sit down?
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah!)
So will the real Shady please stand up

So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah!)
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
So...
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Something's wrong, I can feel it
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Sound like broken records
Spewing venom
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, Dad isn't mad
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
Stiffen up that upper lip
Still "Chunky, but Funky"
Still can fill a whole page with a ten-year-old's rage
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase,
Straighten up little soldier
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Superman aint savin shit, girl you can jump on shady's dick,
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
Tap into thoughts
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
Teeter-totter caught up between trying to be a father and a
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Testing attention please
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
Thanks for dissing me
That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
That a death threat or a love letter?
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
That means I'm on top of my game
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
That was never my object for someone to get killed
That was yesterday
That we didn't mean
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
That's Slim Shady
That's about as far as your buddy goes,
That's all they say, looking boy
That's ammo for my arsenal,
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
That's right, it don't (Hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
That's when I wake up, alarm clocks ringin'
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
That, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
The baggage you had, but as you gather up all your possessions
The cause of my problems
The center of attention back for the winter
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
The morning rain clouds up my window..
The morning rain clouds up my window..
The morning rain clouds up my window..
The morning rain clouds up my window..
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
The way that you turned your back on me
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Then I'll come out in beast mode
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
Then you wonder: "How can
There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
There goes another lawsuit,
There is no sun, and it's so dark
There probably was a problem at the post office or
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
There will be no next time
There you go
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
There's a concept that works
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
There's birds singin'
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow!)
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause man I can hear 'em
These ho's don't want him no mo, he's cold product
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
They ask me am I ok. They ask me if I'm happy
They call me Superman,
They call me Superman,
They call me Superman,
They call me Superman,
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
They can all get fucked.
They can all get fucked.
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim
They try to shut me down on MTV
They want Shady I'm chopped liver
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
They're gone, and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'
They're sayin' you got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
They're screamin' so loud I'll take one last look at the crowd
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
Think not
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop
This fucking black cloud's still follow's me around
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
This is Stan
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo,
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo, you better
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better,
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better,
This song is for anyone
This whole rap city
This world is mine for the taking
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
Throw 'em down
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe...
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
Time to put my life back together right now
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
To burn it in front of you, ho
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
To do black music so selfishly
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
To fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
To focus soley on handling my responsibility's as a father
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
To go your separate ways
To have Runyan Ave and who sulked us up in our corners
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' as*
To intervene between me and this monster
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
To seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
To seize the moment and don't squander it
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To the kids who play 'em
To the same plant, and the same pants
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
To wait by the door and pack his bags
To walk away though
Toilets clogged, Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
Told you this is my fault
Too much for me to wanna
Too much pride,
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
Turns right around and bites you
Twice the magic that started it all
Two little beautiful girls
Two more exits, town is quite near
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
Two years, but you left on the first of May
Uh huh...
Uh, I think about more than I forget
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Uh, be good or be good at it
Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
Unghh, school flunky, pill junky
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Until the roof (Until the roof)
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
Used to get 'em
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Was king of the underground
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
We all fall down like toy soldiers
We all fall down like toy soldiers
We all fall down like toy soldiers
We all fall down...
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
We doin' this once
We feel how we feel inside
We feel how we feel inside
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
We gotta take these cards ourselves
We have nothing in common, poodle
We just met and I just fucked you,
We should be together too
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
We were Bonnie and Clyde
We'll be friends,
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
We'll see how much you'll be partying then,
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
We're all we got in this world
We're gonna have a problem here...
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' sh*t in they eyes
We're running right back
We're still together in my head
We're the ones who made you
We're the ones who made you
We're the ones who made you
We're the ones who made you
Well I'm back
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
Well can it load a gun up for you, and c*ck it too
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
Well, since age twelve, I felt like I'm someone else
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's what they do
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
What I do though for good
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
What do you know? Oops
What happens when you become the main source of pain
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
What it's like, to be me
What it's like, to be me
What it's like, to be me
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
What size you wear? I wear tens
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
What you Mariah? fly through twice,
What you crying about?
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
What you tryin to be, my new wife?
Whatever weather, cold or warm
When I blew; see, it was confusing
When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
When I'm a million leagues above you
When I'm not cooperating
When I'm not even in my harshest
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
When a tornado meets a volcano
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
When they get jealous, they confuse it
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
When they say all of this is approaching its end
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
When you spit 'em
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
When you're in 'em
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
When you're so good that you can't say it
When you're with them
When your fans become your haters
Where must I go, who must I know
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh!)
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Where's my snare?
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
While I can fight
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
While he played piano
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates that's great
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
Who else want it, Kells?
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
Who's that dude
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Why be a king when you can be a God?
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
Why you yellin' at the mic? (Illa)
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
With every faggot you slaughtered
With fucking cornrows
With his windows down and his system up
With rock, shock rap with Doc
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
With the wind in his bag
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
With this like winning a huge meet
With this rappity brat
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old") -ow, Kelly-ooh
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
Won't get out? i'll push you out,
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out,
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Yeah
Yeah I know sometimes things may not always
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
Yeah them chills
Yeah!
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
Yeah, It's been a ride…
Yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (pop)
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah!)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (Hurt me)
Yeah...
Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong.
Yeah?
Yeahh...
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
Yesterday is over
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Yo, His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Yo, yo
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
You are just what the doc ordered
You ask for me?
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You can barely breathe
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
You can get stomped by Obie
You can just close the chapter
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
You can still get roasted, 'cause Marsh is not mellow
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You don't get another chance
You don't know me
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
You don't want that,
You done?
You dress better, I rap better
You ever love somebody so much
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
You fags think it's all a game
You fuckin'... oh
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
You get no love
You get too big and here they come trying to
You got me
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
You high baby?
You kicked me when I was down
You kicked me when I was down
You know I love you
You know I want you too,
You know I want you too,
You know I want you too,
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
You know you want me baby,
You know you want me baby,
You know you want me baby,
You know you want me too
You left our family in shambles
You make elevator music
You meet
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You own it, you better never let it go
You own it, you better never let it go
You own it, you better never let it go
You own it, you better never let it go
You own it, you better never let it go
You own it, you better never let it go
You push
You ran me into the ground
You ran me into the ground
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
You showed me nothing but hate (Haha!)
You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah!)
You sound like a bitch, bitch
You swore you've never hit 'em
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
You waited this long now stop debating
You walked out, I almost died
You want me to tell you somethin?
You want what you can't have,
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
You write normal? Fuck being normal
You yellin' at the mic, you weird beard
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You'll just make me stronger than I was
You'll just make me stronger than I was
You'll just make me stronger than I was
You'll never live without
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
You're a rock star (Baby)
You're a rock star (Baby)
You're a rock star (Baby)
You're a rock star (Baby) (Yeah)
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're fuckin' salty
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You're just as blinded
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me...

something
songs and we can…

the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
thing that we wanted
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get
tryna walk under the trees
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
up
was a fist that hit you…
was to
we was always brothers

well Nate finally got em back sh-t
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
what the f-ck good does that do me now
when I look over and his shirt is off
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as
with his kid
without me
wrists too?
yeah I say it now and you can't hear me
yeah, as difficult as it sounds
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for
you in time
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
