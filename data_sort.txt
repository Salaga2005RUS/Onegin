AAA.B
Feels like no one can beat me
I will stand tall
I will not fall
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until the roof (Until the roof)
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
And its absurd how people hang on every word
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You're coming with me, feel it or not
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up
So...
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
Even if it sounds corny,
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
To fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes
Daddy will be home soon
Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong.
So oh oh
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
So are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone...
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...
Oh, they can all get fucked.
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Just stay true to you
They can all get fucked.
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Just to see what we find
Go inside each other's minds
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Just to see what it'd be like to
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
What it's like, to be me
In my shoes, just to see
Let's see if you can fit your feet
What size you wear? I wear tens
In each other's shoes, at least
I guess we would have to walk a mile
It's probably 110% different
Not just based on my description
But I already told you my whole life story
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
Aunt Edna always told me "Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that"
Even if it meant acting stupid
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Every school I went
In every single place
I just wanted to fit in
For a dad to show up who never did
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
To wait by the door and pack his bags
I was never the type of kid
And get up and get my own
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Now I could have either just
And flip them, don't expect no help
We gotta take these cards ourselves
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
Nobody asked for life to deal us
Just stay true to you so
Oh they can all get fucked.
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Just stay true to you so
Oh they can all get fucked.
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Just to see what we find
Go inside each other's minds
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Just to see what it'd be like to
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
What it's like, to be me
In my shoes, just to see
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
So why don't you all sit down?
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
And half of them ain't even funny like
Laugh at every single joke I crack
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
I don't need no fucking man servant
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
Blend in with the rest of the room
I just want to be just like you
Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
So I try to avoid any eye contact
It's like all eyes on me
Just as soon as I walk in
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Everything is so tense and gloom
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...
Oh, they can all get fucked.
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Just stay true to you
They can all get fucked.
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Just to see what we find
Go inside each other's minds
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Just to see what it'd be like to
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
What it's like, to be me
In my shoes, just to see
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
Here today, gone tomorrow
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
In my own sorrow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
But I just can't admit
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
So I decided just to pick this pen
I'm starting to feel distant again
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
In order for me to pick the mic back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
Fell down and I got right back up
I took my bruises, took my lumps
But I need something to pull me out this dump,
If I could just get over this hump
I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
You know I love you
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You fuckin'... oh
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
Need to get the cock up out it
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
So let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
I'm sick of you bein' whack
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Attempt fails, Budden, L's
Who else want it, Kells?
But you're losin' the fight you picked
But really, I don't care who's in the right
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
Thanks for dissing me
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Little white toothpick
That a death threat or a love letter?
You dress better, I rap better
Your red sweater, your black leather
You're fuckin' salty
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
I'll give him my sandals
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
How the fuck can him and I battle?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
Give your life to be as solidified
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
You'd look up to me, and for the record
But if I was three foot 11
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
Lethal injection
Had to give you a career to destroy it
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
It's your moment
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (pop)
Now I gotta cock back, aim
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the fuck?)
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Next to Ja, next to Benzino-die, motherfucker!
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Still can fill a whole page with a ten-year-old's rage
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
Younger me? No, you're the wack me, it's funny but so true
To burn it in front of you, ho
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
What do you know? Oops
Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (hold up)
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (brrt)
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
By 29 I had three albums that had blew
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old") -ow, Kelly-ooh
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
And have a man-bun?
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, Dad isn't mad
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Realized I forgot to call you back
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Rihanna just hit me on the text
Why you yellin' at the mic? (Illa)
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, you weird beard
Yeah!
Alright
Fuck, your beard's weird
You done?
When your fans become your haters
Shut the fuck up!
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Dr. Dre! 2020!
Ha-ha, woo!
I can't wait, I'm going back
Oh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
So baby
We're the ones who made you
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
You're a rock star (Baby)
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You're the one they adore
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
Now break it down, girl
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
I'm the only one for you
Don't try to deny it, baby
You know you want me too
And baby, you know
I know you want me, girl
You'll never live without
And that's why, my love
We're the ones who made you
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
You're a rock star (Baby)
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You're the one they adore
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
We're the ones who made you
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
You're a rock star (Baby)
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You're the one they adore
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
Now come in, girl
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
He does not mean to lesbian offend
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
On her massive gluteus maximus again
She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
Ahem, back by popular demand
We're the ones who made you
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
You're a rock star (Baby) (Yeah)
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You're the one they adore
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!
Guess who? D'you miss me?
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz
Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict
There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
To have Runyan Ave and who sulked us up in our corners
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
But now he's fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his ressurection
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cuz
And this shit just isn't none of my business
Like fuck it i understand this is business
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Suge
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
That was never my object for someone to get killed
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
Now Ja said I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
I'm supposed to set an example
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down...
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
And I don't need you (No more)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
Don't wanna see you
And I don't need you (No more)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
But what comes around goes around
You ran me into the ground
You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah!)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
And I don't need you (No more)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (Hurt me)
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
You kicked me when I was down
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Uh)
You get no love
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Killin' the flow, slow venom
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow!)
People just get sick 'cause you spit
When you're so good that you can't say it
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
That means I'm on top of my game
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
You can still get roasted, 'cause Marsh is not mellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
And start over from scratch and write new ones
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah!)
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh!)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah!)
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
I ain't never giving in again (Yeah)
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
In my whole entire life, I can (Yeah)
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
Get 'em!
And I don't need you (No more)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
Don't wanna see you
And I don't need you (No more)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
You ran me into the ground
You showed me nothing but hate (Haha!)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
And I don't need you (No more)
That's right, it don't (Hurt me)
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
You kicked me when I was down
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
No love lost, no love found
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
Then I'll come out in beast mode
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Uh, be good or be good at it
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
Uh, I think about more than I forget
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (No love)
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
But it's "Fuck the world," get a child out her
Love
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
No more
Young Money, yeah
Don't hurt me no more
Don't hurt me
Love, love, love
Love, love
Why be a king when you can be a God?
Think not
Don't be a retard, be a king?
And make her fall on her face and
And take a vacation to trip a broad
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
Don't mistake him for Satan
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
But if I can't batter the women
Make lemonade then
Life's handing you lemons
But fuck it
And understand the discrimination
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
Here's what they want from me
Angels fight with devils and
I can feel tugging and struggling
But in my head there's something
Still "Chunky, but Funky"
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
I'm asleep in the front seat
I'm drunk. So, Satan, take the fucking wheel
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
Ill when I speak in tongues
When I'm a million leagues above you
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
Full of myself, but still hungry
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Unghh, school flunky, pill junky
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
Prove that if you were half as nice
How many verses I gotta murder to
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
Let me know when it occurs to you
I don't know what words to use."
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
When they get jealous, they confuse it
Well, that's what they do
You make elevator music
I make elevating music
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
Ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human
Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
On the cable channel
it
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special
While he played piano
At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Just to come and shoot ya
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
You write normal? Fuck being normal
With fucking cornrows
You're pointless as Rapunzel
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
See if I get away with it now
Add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
Put 'em all in a line
One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
On "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
Censor you like that one line I said
You get too big and here they come trying to
Appeal with the skin color of mine
But sometimes when you combine
So I crunch rhymes
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
Was king of the underground
I know there was a time where once I
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
Enough rhymes to
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
What I do though for good
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
My honesty's brutal
It's me
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
But I got your mom deep-throating
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
I'm the walking dead
And I should not be woken
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
Let off then I'm reloading
You're rodent, I'm omnipotent
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Get outta my face, looking boy
Never asked nobody for shit
I'mma work for everything I have
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what d'you say, looking boy?
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
That's all they say, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay
You're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, looking boy
Little gay-looking boy
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Off a plank and
You fags think it's all a game
On the wall of shame
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
And burst in a ball of flames
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church
Into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them
Blow up and be in a position
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Now I lead a new school full of students
MCs get taken to school with this music
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew)
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Immortality like I have got
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah
It's actually disastrously bad
Here's a maxi pad
Rappers are having a rough time period
Feel my wrath of attack
How could I not blow? All I do is drop "F" bombs
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
Only realized it was ironic
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
And at the exact same time
Backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac
With this rappity brat
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
I'm an MC still as honest
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
Made a living and a killing off it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
I got a laptop in my back pocket
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm not taking any chances
Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble
But I don't know what
Like something's about to happen
Just a feeling I've got
Something's wrong, I can feel it
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
Just smile back 
Don't feel no pain
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Almost as if to... say
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
There's birds singin'
That's when I wake up, alarm clocks ringin'
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
The sky darkens, my life flashes
Put it to my brain, scream "Die, Shady!" and pop it
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
But baby, wait!
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
They're screamin' so loud I'll take one last look at the crowd
I take a bow and thank you all for comin' out
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seats
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
And when I'm gone, just carry on
They're gone, and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door it turns to a stage
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late
They're sayin' you got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause man I can hear 'em
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket, it's got her picture
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
She keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
I keep havin' this dream
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't feel no pain, just smile back
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
And when I'm gone, just carry on
Shady made me, but tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye-baby, huh...
Yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
That's Slim Shady
And put hands on her mother, who's a spittin' image of her
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
I'll give you one underdog, then you got to swing by yourself
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Dad's gotta go catch a plane
What happens when you become the main source of pain
And everything you stand for turns on you despite you
Turns right around and bites you
But what happens when karma
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
No, literally give an arm for
Not the expression
Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
In my own words, I guess...
It's my life...
Yeah...
And make him eat every carat don't f*ck with dad (haha)
I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
I'mma break that birdie's neck
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
I'mma sing for you
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma give you the world
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
And if you ask me too
But I promise momma's gon' be alright
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
We feel how we feel inside
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
Everything's gonna be alright
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
It's got a ring to it don't it?
I like the sound of that, yeah
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
And flew you and momma out to see me
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Or shot up on the block
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
And at the time every house that we lived in
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
It's funny
But I promise momma's gon' be alright
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
We feel how we feel inside
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
Everything's gonna be alright
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
I guess it was never meant to be
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
I don't see us ever being together ever again
But things have gotten so bad between us
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I know it's confusing you
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
Two little beautiful girls
When it whirls, when it twirls
When it spins, when it swirls
We're all we got in this world
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
Laney, uncle's crazy, aint he?
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's with you in your prayers
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
You got me
What you crying about?
Stiffen up that upper lip
Straighten up little soldier
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Make sense to you right now
Yeah I know sometimes things may not always
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me now, just for today
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, sing for the year
songs and we can…
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Cause we consider these minutes golden
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' sh*t in they eyes
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Except for a dream, and a f*ckin' rap magazine
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
thing that we wanted
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any f*ckin'
It's f*cked up ain't it
Checks in the mail
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
Just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Well can it load a gun up for you, and c*ck it too
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me now, just for today
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, sing for the year
was a fist that hit you…
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that
can I raise a little girl
It's all political, if my music is literal, and i'm a criminal how the f*ck
If i'm such a f*ckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
police fingerprint me
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while
of these streets quickly
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
every time you mad
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' as*
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
Now how the f*ck did this metamorphosis happen
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
mothafucka they can be great
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me now, just for today
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, sing for the year
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions go…
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
His f*ckin' dad walkin' out
And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
He's a problem child
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
no swearing
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
I don't know, that's just the way I am
In the paper, the news, every day I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
Radio won't even play my jam
In the paper, the news, every day I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
I'm not gonna be able to top a "My Name Is"
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
I don't know, that's just the way I am
In the paper, the news, every day I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
Radio won't even play my jam
In the paper, the news, every day I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
And I am whatever you say I am
And it's burnin', and I have returned
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
And it seems like the media immediately
And all of this controversy circles me
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
I don't know, that's just the way I am
In the paper, the news, every day I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
Radio won't even play my jam
In the paper, the news, every day I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
And I am whatever you say I am
But that's all I can be, it's just me
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
No patience is in me and if you offend me
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
But at least have the decency in you
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Ayo
Ayo
Fuck it, shut up and listen
This song is for anyone
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Dre, just let it run
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to hurt you
I said I'm sorry, Mama
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry, Mama
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to hurt you
I said I'm sorry, Mama
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry, Mama
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to hurt you
I said I'm sorry, Mama
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I never meant to make you cry
I never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry, Mama
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
Yo, yo
Yeah
There you go
I have no snare in my headphones
Where's my snare?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
All my life I was very deprived
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
Ninety-nine percent of my life, I was lied to
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!)
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
Well, since age twelve, I felt like I'm someone else
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Fuck it, let's all stand up!
Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Please stand up, please stand up?
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
Please stand up, please stand up?
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
Please stand up, please stand up?
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
Please stand up, please stand up?
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
So will the real Shady please stand up
With his windows down and his system up
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
Then you wonder: "How can
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
I just get on the mic and spit it
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Please stand up, please stand up?
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
Please stand up, please stand up?
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
And there's a million of us just like me
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I should download her audio on MP3
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Please stand up, please stand up?
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
Please stand up, please stand up?
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
By the time they hit fourth grade
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Feminist women love Eminem
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
We're gonna have a problem here...
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Kids
I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
It'd be so empty without me
But no matter how many fish in the sea
20 million other white rappers emerge
There's a concept that works
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
To do black music so selfishly
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
But it's just me I'm just obscene
So this must mean I'm disgusting
Everybody only wants to discuss me
But sometimes the shit just seems
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
Now let's go, just give me the signal
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Let go
You're too old
You don't know me
You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me
You can get stomped by Obie
And Moby
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
A tisk-it a task-it
I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Testing attention please
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
The center of attention back for the winter
And up under your skin like a splinter
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
Fix your bent antennae
Well I'm back
You ask for me?
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
And it's a disaster
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
So just let me revel and bask
Polluting the air waves a rebel
Could start a revolution
A visionary, vision is scary
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
Fuck you, Debbie!
I just settled all my lawsuits
Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that
But it feels so empty without me
They try to shut me down on MTV
Or let me be me so let me see
So the FCC won't let me be
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
You waited this long now stop debating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)
When I'm not cooperating
When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
Quicker than a shock
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
They want Shady I'm chopped liver
I've created a monster
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, back again
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
Real name no gimmicks
Obie Trice
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better,
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You own it, you better never let it go
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You own it, you better never let it go
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
Baby mama drama's screamin on and
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
This world is mine for the taking
His soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better,
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You own it, you better never let it go
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo,
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You own it, you better never let it go
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
This whole rap city
Back to the lab again yo
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
He's so stacked that he knows
He knows that, but he's broke
It don't matter, he's dope
No, he won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
He's chokin, how everybody's chokin now
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
Yo, His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
To seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry??!
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn???
And set the house on fire
I'mma tie her to the bed
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I know I'm a liar
I just want her back
I'm tired of the games
Even though I know it's lies
I love the way you lie...
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry??!
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn???
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Out the window
Now you get to watch her leave
But you lied again
Life is no Nintendo game
You don't get another chance
Next time you'll show restraint
But you promised her
Playin' over
Sound like broken records
It's a different day
Yesterday is over
That was yesterday
Cause today
Guess that they don't know ya
To go your separate ways
So they say it's best
It controls you both
It's the rage that took over
When you're in 'em
So lost in the moments
Pin 'em
I think I love you baby...
I think I want you too...
I know you want me baby,
do
that I got
Feet fail me not or not this may be the only opportunity
So here I go is my shot.
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
life
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Too much for me to wanna
prima donna
Teeter-totter caught up between trying to be a father and a
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
And it's no movie, there's no Makai Pfeiffer, this is my
Cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo, you better
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You own it, you better never let it go
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
You own it, you better never let it go

Da da dum da dum da da
I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
He nose dove and sold nada
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
These ho's don't want him no mo, he's cold product
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
Lonely roads, God only knows
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
Maybe we'll someday grow,
Maybe I'll love you one day,
Monday through Sunday yo,
Saturday through Sunday Monday,
Bitches they come they go,
But I do know one thing though,
Don't mean to ruin your plans,
Girl you just blew your chance,
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand,
End up with two back hands,
Don't touch what you can't grab,
Ooh girl that's too damn bad,
You want what you can't have,
Good lordy-wody you must be blown off that water bottle,
Leave handprints all accross you,
There goes another lawsuit,
I'll snap you off that bar stool,
That's ammo for my arsenal,
Add also, don't grow partial,
First off you don't know Marshall,
I'm not phazed,
First thing you said...
Bitch you make me hurl.
Oh boy you drive me crazy...
Come be in shady's world...
I wanna save you girl,
I'm here to rescue you,
They call me Superman,
You know I want you too,

Lets let our love unfurl,
I wanna grow together,
Come be in shady's world,
I'm here to save you girl,
I think I love you too,

I think I want you too...
I know you want me baby,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
Maybe I'll love you one day,
Monday through Sunday yo,
Saturday through Sunday monday,
Bitches they come they go,
But I do know one thing though,
We just met and I just fucked you,
Never loved you enough to trust you,
How could it ever be just us two?
But I guess that's just what sluts do,
Not a jealous man, but females lie,
Between you and I,
Too much pride,
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys,
Neither do I,
You don't want that,
We'll see how much you'll be partying then,
Never know what kind of car i'll be in,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend,
I'll call you again,
We'll be friends,
That's about as far as your buddy goes,
Bitch so what?
Can't we fuck?
Everybody knows,
It's no secret,
I love these hoes,
Don't get me wrong,
Your superman, your superman...
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
I can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe...
Maybe we'll someday grow,
Maybe i'll love you one day,
Monday through sunday yo,
Saturday through sunday monday,
Bitches they come, they go,
But I do know one thing though,
What you Mariah? fly through twice,
What you tryin to be, my new wife?
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life,
Am I too nice? buy you ice,
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out,
Puss blew out, copin shit,
Won't get out? i'll push you out,
Don't put out? i'll put you out,
Kiss my dick, hit my cash, i'd rather have you whip my ass,
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face,
I'll tell a mo'fuckin slut to her face,
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase,
Superman aint savin shit, girl you can jump on shady's dick,
In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? you make me sick,
I'll never let another chick bring me down,
Got no ring on this finger now,
I'm single now,
Leap tall hoes in a single bound,
They call me Superman,
Bitch you make me hurl...
You want me to tell you somethin?
Yeah?
Yeahh...
You high baby?
Mmmhh
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Tap into thoughts
Trapped in his own drawings
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Twice the magic that started it all
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Before it fades into black and it's all over
So one last time, I'm back
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So before you rest your case
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
If there's anything you have left to say
The baggage you had, but as you gather up all your possessions
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
If you don't stop after they call you the
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the hindsight to say, "I told you so!"
Sad, but it happens to all of them
No more fans that are calling your name, cameras are off
Of you not knowing what you had until it's gone
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
I represent everything, you take for granted
That, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
Coming back on you every woman you insult
With every faggot you slaughtered
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
I'm the ringing in your ears
I am your lack of a conscience
After the track is demolished
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas
Toilets clogged, Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
When they say all of this is approaching its end
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
Now say you hate homos again!
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh hope you can swim good!
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
New plan Stan
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
Two more exits, town is quite near
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Since you love you're city so much
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
Eminem killed by M&M
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Just to try to get people to buy
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they suck
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Continue to peep, still bent low
Like I reach my full potential, I peaked
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
See, it's sad it came to this point
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
I've been driving around your side of this town
Poof, then I'm gone
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
The cause of my problems
And gee who better to talk to than you?
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, go!
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
You left our family in shambles
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy
You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Hit the verbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
mortom
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post
masteroff.org
I apologize
There will be no next time
Next time
At the dry wall
I'll aim my fist
Next time I'm pissed
Look me in the eyeball
Told you this is my fault
In my voice when I talk
Don't you hear sincerity
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Come inside
To walk away though
I love you too much
All I know is
When a tornado meets a volcano
Maybe that's what happens
Isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe our relationship
Baby it was me
It wasn't you
Baby please come back
You're just as blinded
But when it comes to love
You're the same as me
As mine is
But your temper's just as bad
Same routine
Into the same patterns
And we fall back
That we didn't mean
Did things
Now I know we said things
I love the way you lie...
masteroff.org
Throw 'em down
Scratch, claw, bit 'em
Pull each other's hair
You push
When you spit 'em
And these words
Spewing venom
Now you're in each other's face
Never do nothing to hurt 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em
Of looking at 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick
Used to get 'em
Yeah them chills
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Even know what hit 'em
And neither one of you
You meet
When you're with them
You can barely breathe
You ever love somebody so much
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry??!
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn???
I guess I don't know my own strength
I'll never stoop so low again
I laid hands on her
I don't even know his name
Who's that dude
I snap
I feel so ashamed
It's awful
But when it's bad
She's Lois Lane
With the wind in his bag
I'm Superman
It's going great
Cause when it's going good
It's so insane
Here we go again
We're running right back
And I love it
She fucking hates me
She resuscitates me
And right before I'm about to drown
I sufficate
And I love it the more that I suffer
It's like I'm huffing paint
Drunk from the hate
High of a love
masteroff.org
It's like I'm in flight
As long as the wrong feels right
While I can fight
But I still fight
I can't breathe
In my windpipe
And right now there's a steel knife
I can only tell you what it feels like
I can't tell you what it really is
I love the way you lie...
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie.......
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..!
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn..?
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
Put a ??? and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
To focus soley on handling my responsibility's as a father
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
Admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Time to put my life back together right now
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
And I just can't keep living this way
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
But it's time to exercise these demons
This fucking black cloud's still follow's me around
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
I'm way too up to back down
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
Cause I ain't playin' around
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh”
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
For that fuck your feelings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for christmas
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit and
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
I'll get you there
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
Now some of you might still be in that place
I guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
Yeah, It's been a ride…
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Whatever weather, cold or warm
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
And a life we could've had and we could've been
First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
No one could hurt me like you could've
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
Other side of my pack and stuck a spike, too, should've
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Cause if you could've took my life you would've
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I
We were Bonnie and Clyde
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized
You walked out, I almost died
Cause I'm stronger than I was
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
I'll get back up and uhhh
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
You'll just make me stronger than I was
But you won't break me
Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
And you're still in love with me
We're still together in my head
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
And left nothing, nothing for me
Cause you left and you took everything I had left
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
Aggressed, you can't leave
But you're all that I love
Cause on the inside you're ugly, man
A beautiful face is all that you had
Cause I'm stronger than I was
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
I'll get back up and uhhh
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
You'll just make me stronger than I was
But you won't break me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
And you've had enough of me
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?
And you must hate me
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
Snatch the keys from your hand
And I cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I believe I'm striding the roads, I guess I can't breathe
You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
Bitch you make me hurl.
Oh boy you drive me crazy...
Come be in shady's world...
I wanna save you girl,
I'm here to rescue you,
They call me Superman,
You know I want you too,
You know you want me baby,
Lets let our love unfurl,
I wanna grow together,
Come be in Shady's world,
I'm here to save you girl,
I think I love you too,
Everybody come take my hand
I'm not afraid to take a stand
yeah, as difficult as it sounds
it don't stop there
hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
the motor city mo-town
but you can bet you're legacy they'll never forget
moving past it, it still aint registered yet
well I put em in your cask-owww
it must have been at least 16 years ago
well Nate finally got em back sh-t
my mother stole from you
and by the way them playboy rings
and I still have to get you back for that sh-t
and snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
and the entire time you're just laughing at me
like I'm on fire
meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt
in their skin, we don't burn"
black people they got melatonin
I'm like you gon fry and like
when I look over and his shirt is off
I'm moaning I just wanna get home
just to give me some comfort
tryna walk under the trees
it was like 90 degrees, I was catching a sun burn
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
never thought about each others skin colours
we was always brothers
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
Doody, thats what we call each other
difficult as it sounds
if its true, how the f-ck am I supposed to get over you
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
man how you touch so many f-cking lives and just leave us
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
but Sharonda actually talks to me now
and dawg you'll never believe this
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
or I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
but somehow I know you're near me in presence
what the f-ck good does that do me now
yeah I say it now and you can't hear me
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
and I continuosly stare at pictures of you
Doody, most of my life its just been me and you there
and they genuinly care
or am I just a little snappy
Are they asking me that because of the sh-t thats been thrown at me
They ask me am I ok. They ask me if I'm happy
Cause I'm stronger than I was.
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
I'll get back up and uhhh
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
You'll just make me stronger than I was
But you won't break me
I may never trust someone
I'm still angry, yeah, I maybe
And after all that's said and done
But if you blame me, you're crazy
I gave you all, you gave me none
But I hate you cause you drained me
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
Two years, but you left on the first of May
It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
I'm done being your punching bag
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
I'mma be late for the pity party
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
Love that tattoo...what's that say?
fans
Haily Jade...I love that name,
Ooh yeah girl run that game...
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me...
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
I hang around big stars all day,
Night"
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
oh boy you drive me crazy...
come be in Shady's world...
I wanna save you girl,
I'm here to rescue you,
They call me Superman,
You know I want you too,
You know you want me baby,
Let's let our love unfurl.
I wanna grow together,
Come be in shady's world,
I'm here to save you girl,
I think I love you too...
I think I love you baby...
I know what you wanna hear...
Uh huh...
hahaha..Talk to me...
As we pick up the last Mathers left off
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You can just close the chapter
Oh, you thought it was over
Just when I may have needed you most
The way that you turned your back on me
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
But I am coming for closure
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
drowning
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
It's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
I'm torn in my limbs, by each one of my friends
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
There is no sun, and it's so dark
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
it
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
if the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Where must I go, who must I know
Who must I show, to bust my flow
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
A certificate of authenticity, you'd never even see
It's different, it's a certain significance,
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
it
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
best
Please don't let me be bitchin holdin no regular job
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
And I try, sit alone and I cry
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
To the same plant, and the same pants
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
So I must then get, off the bus then slip
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
and I clam up (wham) I just slam shut
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Damn!
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
And show these people what my level of skill's like
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
I wrote it on the Starter cap
was to
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it
with his kid
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant
made me sick
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that

I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches

I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?

You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling

Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now

Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
Shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
See Slim; {*screaming*}
without me
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE
about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM
about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
I hope you know I ripped ALL of your pictures off the wall
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy

Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?

Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
tell it
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cos you
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
I'm depressed
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I never knew my father neither;
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
four hours and you just said, "No."
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
Matthew
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer
a chance
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have
The morning rain clouds up my window..
it's not so bad..
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
but your picture on my wall
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
and I can't see at all
got out of bed at all
My tea's gone cold I'm wonder why I..
fan
This is Stan
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was phat
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest
him
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I'ma name her Bonnie
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm about to be a father
daughter?
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
something
There probably was a problem at the post office or
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates that's great
But if one kid out of a hundred million
I ain't here to save the fucking children
To the kids who play 'em
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
Give every kid who got played at
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
My OCD is conking me in the head
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
And save me from myself and all this conflict
To intervene between me and this monster
Cause I need an interventionist
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders)
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
To seize the moment and don't squander it
No, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Cause I'm
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
With this like winning a huge meet
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
Hit the lottery, oh wee
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
When I blew; see, it was confusing
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
Get along with the voices inside of my head
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
2nd Chorus: full volume with beat right after
1st Chorus: volume gradually grows over raindrop background
it's not so bad..
but your picture on my wall
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
and I can't see at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
got out of bed at all
My tea's gone cold I'm wonder why I..
Chorus: Dido
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
